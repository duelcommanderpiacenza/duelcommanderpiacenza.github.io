// Recomputes every player's auto-badge assignments (js/auto-badges.js) and
// fully replaces the precomputed player_badges_auto table with the result —
// called after closing or reopening an event, opening/closing a league,
// deleting an event or league (see app.js, events-admin.js,
// standalone-events-admin.js, leagues-admin.js), and saving a badge
// (badges-admin.js) — the only moments the published match/standings data
// (or the rules themselves) actually change. Public pages then just read that table instead of running the
// (expensive, several-rules-refetch-overlapping-data) live computation
// themselves on every page view.
